##**🧩 Folder Details
📂 C_Module/**

The C_Module folder includes everything related to your C programming course — from early exercises to full assignments, classwork, and test files.

##**📂 Assignments/**

This section includes your assignment folders.
Each folder is named as Assignment_No_XX, where XX represents the assignment number.

**🗂️ Example:**
```
Assignments/
├── Assignment_No_00/
│   ├── Q1.c
│   ├── Q2.c
│   └── ...
├── Assignment_No_01/
│   ├── Q1.c
│   ├── Q2.c
│   └── Q3.c
└── Assignment_No_02/
    └── ...

```
Each .c file represents an individual problem or program from that assignment.

##**📂 ClassWork/**

This folder includes source files and notes from daily practice sessions conducted during classes.

You can store:

Programs demonstrated during lectures

Concept-based examples (loops, arrays, strings, pointers, etc.)

Reference files for revision

**🧾 Example:**
```
ClassWork/
├── LoopsPractice.c
├── ArraysDemo.c
└── StringFunctions.c
```

**📂 Test/**

All your internal or module tests are stored here in separate folders like Test_01, Test_02, etc.
Each test folder contains .c files for every question in that test.

##**🧾 Example:**
```
Test/
└── Test_01/
    ├── Q1.c
    ├── Q2.c
    └── Q3.c
```
